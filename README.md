Computer Vision based people counter


**Project Description:**

People Counting based on CCTV videos: computer vision research project supervised by Professor Shueng-Han Gary Chan in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology

**Key Objectives:**

The project aims to use computer vision technology to develop a system that can perform video analysis on CCTV footage for the purpose of people (re)identification and counting

The immediate practical application of the prototype is in the monitoring of number of people passing on a staircase in campus main hall to determine the effectiveness of schoolâ€™s initiative to promote healthy on-campus life style

**Adopted Methodology, Results and Areas for Improvement:**

I coded the computer vision algorithm, built and tuned the Convolutional Neural Network for improvement of detecting overlapping figures and different figures due to projection and for optimization of the efficiency through compression during idle time.

The system achieved an accurate detection of figures appeared in surveillance camera and effective identification of figures overlapping and projecting issues.
